    <h1>Breif about Bhagvad Gita</h1>
    <h5>The Mahabharata is an ancient Indian epic where the main story revolves around two branches of a family - the
        Pandavas and Kauravas - who, in the Kurukshetra War, battle for the throne of Hastinapura. Interwoven into this
        narrative are several smaller stories about people dead or living, and philosophical discourses. Krishna-Dwaipayan
        Vyasa, himself a character in the epic, composed it; as, according to tradition, he dictated the verses and Ganesha
        wrote them down. At 100,000 verses, it is the longest epic poem ever written, generally thought to have been
        composed in the 4th century BCE or earlier. The events in the epic play out in the Indian subcontinent and
        surrounding areas. It was first narrated by a student of Vyasa at a snake-sacrifice of the great-grandson of one of
        the major characters of the story. Including within it the Bhagavad Gita, the Mahabharata is one of the most
        important texts of ancient Indian, indeed world, literature.
    
        The prelude
        Shantanu, the king of Hastinapur, was married to Ganga (personification of the Ganges) with whom he had a son called
        Devavrat. Several years later, when Devavrat had grown up to be an accomplished prince, Shantanu fell in love with
        Satyavati. Her father refused to let her marry the king unless the king promised that Satyavati's son and
        descendants would inherit the throne. Unwilling to deny Devavrat his rights, Shantanu declined to do so but the
        prince, on coming to know of the matter, rode over to Satyavati's house, vowed to renounce the throne and to remain
        celibate throughout his life. The prince then took Satyavati home to the palace so that the king, his father, could
        marry her. On account of the terrible vow that he'd taken that day, Devavrat came to be known as Bheeshm. Shantanu
        was so pleased with his son that he granted to Devavrat the boon of choosing the time of his own death.
    
        In time, Shantanu and Satyavati had two sons. Soon thereafter, Shantanu died. Satyavati's sons still being minors,
        the affairs of the kingdom were managed by Bheeshm and Satyavati. By the time these sons reached adulthood, the
        elder one had died in a skirmish with some gandharvas (heavenly beings) so the younger son, Vichitravirya, was
        enthroned. Bheeshm then abducted the three princesses of a neighbouring kingdom and brought them over to Hastinapur
        to be wedded to Vichitravirya. The eldest of these princesses declared that she was in love with someone else, so
        she was let go; the two other princesses were married to Vichitravirya who died soon afterwards, childless.</h5>
